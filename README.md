# Analyzing Clairy sensor data

[Clairy](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/628579643/clairy-the-most-amazing-natural-air-purifier/) is a natural air purifier, that started as a Kickstarter campaign.
Apart from cleaning the air, it also has sensor for measuring air quality, humidity and room temperature. The Clairy app allows you to view, but not export the data coming from the sensors.
Luckily, the app calls an API we can use to work with the data on ourselves.
